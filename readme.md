## Project Overview

FFM (Family Financial Management) Application is a **full-stack application** built with a **Flask Backend** following the FlaskMVC pattern and **React Native Frontend**. This app aims to provide users with a seamless way to track and manage their financial transactions, budgets and goals.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Backend Deployment**: Render
- **Frontend Deployment**: Expo

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps to install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Chroma-Corps/FFM-Application.git
$ cd FFM-Application
```

### 2. Installing Backend Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Then, install the Python dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Installing Frontend Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js installed. Install Expo CLI globally if you haven't already:

```bash
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

Navigate to the React folder and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
$ cd React
$ npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Setting Up and Running Flask
Start by setting up the backend. First, initialize the Flask application with the following command:

``` bash
$ flask init
```

This will set up the necessary configurations, such as database migrations.
Next, start the Flask development server:
```bash
$ flask run
```
The Flask backend will now be running locally.

### Starting the React Native Frontend
Once the Flask backend is running, open another terminal and navigate to the React folder:
```bash
$ cd React
```

Now, launch the React Native development server with:
```bash
$ npx expo start
```
